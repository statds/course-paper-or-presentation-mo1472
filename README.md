The purpose of this paper is to determine whether social media use serves as a possible mediator
between the dependent variable, memory function and mental health issues, and the independent variable,
social media usage. In order to assess our study topics, we might employ a variety of mediation
models. Whether in a college class or at work, mediation analysis is a subject that needs more
explanation. A third variable known as a mediator variable is used in statistical mediation
analysis to help explain the link between an independent variable and a dependent variable.
Going into this research, the goal is to determine the strength of the association between
excessive social media use and memory function and mental health issues. This study will most likely confirm
current findings and presumptions based on a number of the available investigations.
